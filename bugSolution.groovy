```groovy
def myMethod(Closure closure) {
  try {
    closure.call()
  } catch (Exception e) {
    println "Error in closure: ${e.message}"
  }
}

myMethod {println "Hello"}

myMethod {it -> println it}

myMethod {a, b -> println a + b}

myMethod {a, b, c -> println a + b + c} //Illustrates the error handling

//Example demonstrating thread-safe closure execution (if needed)
def threadSafeClosure(closure) {
  new Thread({ 
    try {
        closure()    
    } catch (Exception e) {
        println "Error in Thread: ${e.message}"
    }
  }).start()
}

//Illustrates usage of explicit parameters and error handling
myMethod( {a,b -> if(a==null || b == null){ println "Null Parameter Encountered"; return;} println a+b})
```
The solution demonstrates improved error handling by wrapping the closure execution in a `try-catch` block. This ensures that exceptions thrown within the closure are caught and handled gracefully, preventing application crashes.  A thread-safe example using `new Thread` with error handling within the thread's execution is also provided to handle concurrency issues.  The example also uses explicit parameter declaration in a closure to prevent unexpected errors from implicit parameter usage.  It is very important to ensure that parameters passed to closures are checked to avoid null pointer exceptions.
