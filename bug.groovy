```groovy
def myMethod(Closure closure) {
  closure.call()
}

myMethod {println "Hello"}

myMethod {it -> println it}

myMethod {a,b -> println a+b}
```
In this example, the `myMethod` function accepts a closure as an argument. The first call passes a simple closure that prints "Hello". The second call uses a closure with an implicit parameter (`it`), which is a common Groovy feature, that prints the implicit parameter. The last call uses a closure with explicit parameters and prints their sum. This can cause unexpected behavior if the number of arguments passed to the closure does not match the number of parameters defined in the closure, potentially resulting in `MissingMethodException` or incorrect results.

Another common error is related to handling exceptions within closures passed to methods like `each` or `collect` or threads. Unhandled exceptions within these closures may not be caught by the main program's `try-catch` blocks, causing silent failures or application crashes. 

This can also apply to closures being executed asynchronously or in separate threads.  If a closure updates shared state, issues with race conditions or synchronization could arise.

Also, the use of the `delegate` property in closures can sometimes lead to problems with unexpected behavior due to scope issues if not managed carefully.
